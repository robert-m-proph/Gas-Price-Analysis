# Gas Price Analysis

This program will read the contents of the GasPrices.txt file, which contains
the weekly average price of a gallon of gas from 1993-2013. The format is mm-dd-yyyy:price.
The program then promts a menu asking for user input on what they would like to 
do with the program/data. The following will be performed by the program:

1) Average Price Per Year: 
     - For every year in the file
     
2) Average Price per Month: 
     - For each month in the file
     
3) Highest and Lowest Prices per year

4) List of Prices, Lowest to Highest: 
     - Will generate a txt file that list the dates and prices, sorted from 
       lowest to highest
       
5) List of Prices, Highest to Lowest:
     - Will generate a txt file that list the dates and prices, sorted from 
       highest to lowest

This program is finished. However, I am still improving the structure and repetitive use of similar code.
